## Overview

In probability, we often use counting methods to determine the size of sample spaces, distinct events, etc. 

Additionally, when you are starting to become familiar with properties of probability (like inclusion-exclusion), it is helpful to have a method of simulating results, especially if results are not intuitive.

## Counting

In lecture, we reviewed different methods of counting for sampling with and without replacement and sampling when order does or does not matter. 

Let $n$ be the number of options we have and let $k$ be the number of samples we take. As a quick review, we have the following methods: 

- Sampling with replacement, order does matter: $n^k$
- Sampling with replacement, order does not matter: $\binom{n + k - 1}{k}$
  - Bose-Einstein analagous problem
- Sampling without replacement, order does matter: $n (n - 1) \cdots (n - k + 1)$
- Sampling without replacement, order does not matter: $\binom{n}{k}$

### Sampling in R

In R, we have several analagous functions for these scenarios. One of the most useful functions is `sample`. Take a look at `?sample` and its parameters. 

What are the appropriate function calls for the following scenarios? Fill in the code below each comment. 

```{r}
# Define n and k; population and sample_size
population <- 110
sample_size <- 10

# Sampling with replacement

# Sampling without replacement

# Creating a permutation

```

However, although the above creates a sample, it does not provide detail on how many samples exist. To count the samples, R can help with a brute force approach.

Q: What does "brute force" mean?

Hint: the function `expand.grid` may be helpful.

```{r}
# Brute force approach

```

Sampling when order does not matter can be more difficult to reproduce. There may not be a default R function for this type of sampling but we can cobble together some functions to make this work. 

There are many ways of solving this problem. Try and think of your own solutions. The one I will demonstrate is not particularly elegant but it works.

```{r}
# Brute force counting of unordered combinations 

# Sampling with replacement

# Sampling without replacement

```

Alternatively, if you remember the properties, you can use the function `choose()`. 

## Simulation

The simulation for the birthday problem and De Montmort has been sourced from lecture and from the textbook. 

### Birthday problem

What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday in a group of people? This is a nice introductory result on how probability can be counter-intuitive. 

Q: Why is the probability of a shared birthday much higher than $n/365$, which is what many people intuitively guess?

There are a few ways of solving this problem. This is mostly a review of last week, with a couple new tricks. 

```{r}
# Last week
bday <- function(n = 25) {
  x <- round(runif(n, 1, 365))
  match_bday <- length(x) - length(unique(x))
  y <- ifelse(match_bday > 0, T, F)
  y
}

# Solving with `sample` instead of `runif`

# Solving with `duplicated`

# Solving with `tabulate`

# Solving with built-in functions

# Solving with built-in functions

```

#### Reverse birthday problem

How many people would be required for the group to have a 50% chance of having a birthday on your birthday?

Q: What is the intuitive answer?

Q: Can you solve this purely with simulation or should you derive this mathematically first?

```{r}
# Insert solution here
```

#### Extra special bonus

How many people would be required for the group to have a 50% chance of having a birthday on every day of the year?

```{r}

```


### De Montmort (matching problem)

Although it is theoretically possible to generate every arrangement of cards and then determine if they are winning, this is probably not useful.

Q: Why would this be a bad idea? (Don't overthink this).

```{r}

```


## More examples

In many cases, how you simulate a problem can be influenced by the exact nature of the problem. In many cases, you can find easier ways to represent data. 

### Phone number problem

Let's work through simulation of the phone number problem from the homework. Note that this solution will likely *not* be accepted as the full solution, but it is a useful check. 

```{r}
# How many unique 7-digit numbers can be created that do not start with 0 or 1?

# From the 0,1 set, how many numbers can be created that do not art with 911?
```

### Tagging animals to estimate population

To determine the population of a species in a region, it is impractical to count all of them. Instead, field biologists may tag, release, and recapture animals. 

Field researchers will capture a certain number of animals in a region and harmlessly tag them. The animals are then released. After a certain period of time, the same number of animals is recaptured and the number of tagged animals is counted. Using this method, researchers are able to estimate the population.

Q: What are the assumptions in this scenario?

The random variable distribution that dictates the dynamics here is the Negative Binomial. We will discuss this in a future lecture.

We can make a graphical representation of this scenario. We can also estimate error bars. 

```{r}

```

## Other notes

The style I use for coding in R has been influenced by Hadley Wickham's style guide, available here: https://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html. 

For any simulation, make sure you understand the problem before you attempt to simulate it. This has been an issue with De Montmort's matching problem.
